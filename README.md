# Demographic Data Analysis of Physician Fee Schedule on Insurance
Our vision is to set up anchor prices for physicians or patientsâ€™ reference on different medical procedure services around the demographic area in the United States. First, we have collected all data sources to compute the state level anchor procedure service prices for 51 states in the United States. Later on, we have discussed two special cases on state Indiana and Connecticut on the county level anchor prices.
